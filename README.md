# MovieDiscovery
Design and implement a responsive web application that helps users decide “What Should I Watch Tonight?” by browsing curated movie suggestions and searching for titles or actors.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
